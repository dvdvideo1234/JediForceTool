[h1] Description [/h1]
Annoyed loosing time to walk or wander, this tool is just for you!
Reload on an prop will bring it back to you, on world will teleport you to the hit position.
Pointing to an entity shows its coordinate system, mass center OBB center and position.
Pointing to the world shows world's coordinate system. No need to place a texture to see where
is World X is anymore ! Mouse 1 / Mouse 2 to Push / pull a prop. The tool is coded in the most
part for developers to be able to see the effect of applying forces and teleporting to see the effects.
